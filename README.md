Gamification of Preventing Violence against Children;  Lua; Corona SDK; SP 2015-2016

Special Problem 2

This study aims to develop and design an application through gamification for  Android platforms. The goal of this research is to create a child-friendly and interactive gamified application that can educate users on how to prevent violence against children.
The gamified application will be developed in a user-friendly 2D (two-dimensional) interface with appropriate colors for symbolizations, animations and sounds to add entertainment to the game. There are two kinds of environments involved: school and community; and each consists of five levels starting from bad to worst. The player will go through a series of scenarios related to physical and non-physical bullying and sexual abuse and will be asked on how to react/do in that certain scenario by using the controls of the game and by simply answering a question. The player will also be guided by instructions, tips, trivia, and the rights of children that will be displayed along the storyline. There will be a corresponding reward in a form of badges for each level successfully finished by the player.
Elementary students with ages ranging from 9 to 12 are the primary target users of the game because children at these ages are most likely prone to bullying and abuses in school, community or even at home. Also, teachers and advocates are the secondary users and will be in-charge of utilizing the application as a tool for teaching and promoting advocacy of fighting violence against children. The gamified application is conceptualized for Bicolanos. Thus, aside from the English and Tagalog language, it will use Bicol vernacular as a secondary language to easily and effectively communicate with Bicolano children.
